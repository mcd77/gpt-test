description: "How Codex generated a Next.js blog and deployed it to GitHub Pages."

This blog was created entirely with Codex, OpenAI's code generation tool. Using Codex, all pages, components, and configuration were produced automatically — no manual coding required.

I started by prompting Codex to scaffold a simple Next.js blog. Within seconds, it generated the essential files: the layout components, dynamic routes for blog posts, and even the getStaticProps and getStaticPaths functions for static generation. Styling? Done. Routing? Handled. It was like pair programming with an assistant who doesn’t need to sleep.

After generating the static site with next export, I deployed the output to GitHub Pages — a free and easy way to host static websites. With just a few Git commands, the site was live. No build servers, no CI pipelines, no hosting costs.

This project was a fun experiment in building with AI. While it's not replacing the craft of software development anytime soon, tools like Codex make it faster and easier to go from idea to deployment especially for small personal projects.

If you're curious about using AI to help write code, I definitely recommend giving Codex (or its cousin, GitHub Copilot) a try. It’s not magic, but it sure feels close.
